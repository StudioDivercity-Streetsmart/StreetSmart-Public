# AI-Driven Urban Street Redesign: Research and Model Proposal

## 1. Introduction

This report outlines an AI-driven approach for urban street redesign that leverages recent advances in semantic inpainting, segmentation, and generative modeling. The goal is to transform street-view images—removing outdated elements and introducing new, walkable urban features—while preserving the original image’s tone and meeting urban planning standards.

## 3. Proposed AI Model Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Sources:**  
  - Collect before-and-after images from OpenStreetMap, Google Street View, and manual annotations.
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Use panoptic segmentation (e.g., OneFormer) to segment streets, sidewalks, greenery, and buildings.
  - Generate masks for regions eligible for transformation.
  - Ensure segmentation robustness by incorporating image alignment or calibration techniques if “after” images have slight perspective differences.

### Step 2: Model Training
- **Approach 1: GAN-Based Image Translation**  
  - Utilize models like Pix2Pix or CycleGAN to learn transformations from paired before-and-after images.
- **Approach 2: Diffusion-Based Inpainting**  
  - Use Stable Diffusion with ControlNet to selectively modify image regions based on urban planning guidelines.
- **Tone Preservation:**  
  - Integrate loss functions that maintain the original image’s tone, such as perceptual losses or modified KL divergence variants that reward tonal consistency while allowing necessary changes.

### Step 3: Addressing Data Collection Challenges with an Iterative RL Approach
- **Challenge:** Limited availability of paired “before” images.
- **Proposed Solution:**  
  - **Pre-trained Pairing:**  
    - Begin with a pre-trained generative model paired with a language model that generates explicit modification instructions to create synthetic “before and after” pairs.
  - **Quality Filtering:**  
    - Apply rejection sampling or similar techniques to filter out pairs that do not meet quality or tonal consistency standards, using a mix of automated and human feedback.
  - **Fine-Tuning:**  
    - Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the curated pairs, incorporating loss functions that emphasize tonal preservation.
  - **RL-Based Iterative Refinement:**  
    - Iteratively generate new pairs using a reward function that emphasizes realism, adherence to urban planning guidelines, and tonal fidelity, updating the model with high-reward pairs through repeated cycles.

### Step 4: User-Guided Editing Interface
- **Interface Development:**  
  - Build a web-based UI (backend using Flask/Django and frontend using React.js) where urban planners can:
    - Select regions for transformation.
    - Provide text prompts (e.g., "Convert this street to a pedestrian-friendly zone") integrated with models like CLIP and Stable Diffusion.

### Step 5: Model Evaluation & Continuous Refinement
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Use metrics such as Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), supplemented by feedback from urban planners.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Implement a human-in-the-loop process combined with iterative reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to continuously refine the model.

## 4. Expected Outcome

- **Robust Image Transformation:**  
  - A model capable of selectively editing street images while keeping unaffected areas intact.
- **User-Guided Modifications:**  
  - An intuitive interface that enables urban planners to guide transformations through region selection and text prompts.
- **Realistic Urban Redesigns:**  
  - Outputs that are realistic, policy-compliant, and preserve the original image’s aesthetic tone.
- **Iterative Model Enhancement:**  
  - Continuous improvement through an iterative RL-based refinement process, incorporating human feedback.
- **Real-World Integration:**  
  - Use of GIS and OpenStreetMap data to ensure that generated designs meet actual urban planning constraints.

## 6. Conclusion

This proposal presents a comprehensive AI-driven pipeline for urban street redesign. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in inpainting, segmentation, and generative modeling, the approach aims to produce realistic, user-guided urban transformations that adhere to modern planning standards while preserving the original aesthetic tone of street images.
